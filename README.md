# toeat - Your recipe collection
### Work in progress

Exercising **TypeScript, ReactJS and styled components** with a 
simple recipe manager application. 

In the application, you can create **your collection of recipes** 
in a simple and easy to understand way. 

## Features
* **create** recipes - each one has a **photo, title, ingredients' list, 
preparation details, necessary equipment** and other details for a 
better understanding of its complexity and sizing;
* **search** recipes based on **title or ingredients**;
* **filter** them by **cooking time**, **wanted or disliked 
ingredients**, **course meal**, **number of ingredients** 
and/or degree of **difficulty**;
* **adapt the ingredient quantities** based on the desired 
**number of servings**;
* **edit or remove** existing recipes, if necessary.

See the [application framework](./toeat-framework.png).
